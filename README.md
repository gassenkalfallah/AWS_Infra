## 🧭 Project Overview

This project aims to migrate a legacy DevOps setup running on virtual machines to a fully automated, containerized, cloud-native infrastructure on AWS using modern DevOps best practices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Migrate the legacy infrastructure to AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Containerize services and orchestrate them using Kubernetes (EKS)
- Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitLab
- Enable cloud-native backup & recovery with Velero
- Improve scalability, maintainability, and deployment automation

---

## 🧪 Methodology

Agile Scrum methodology with 4 major sprints:
1. **Provision Cloud Infrastructure** with Terraform & AWS (VPC, EC2, EKS)
2. **Automate IaC versioning** and repository control using GitLab
3. **CI/CD for App Deployment** – Deploy an HR Portal (multi-service app) on Kubernetes using GitLab Pipelines
4. **Implement Backup/Restore** using Velero + Amazon S3

---

## 📦 Architecture Overview

> *(Insert architecture diagrams here once uploaded)*

- **VPC** with Public/Private Subnets
- **EKS Cluster** with Auto Scaling Nodes
- **Dockerized Microservices** deployed via GitLab CI
- **S3 Buckets** used for backup storage
- **Velero** for Kubernetes-native disaster recovery

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

| Domain         | Tools                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Infrastructure | AWS (VPC, EC2, EKS, S3, ECR)      |
| IaC            | Terraform                         |
| Containers     | Docker                            |
| Orchestration  | Kubernetes (EKS)                  |
| CI/CD          | GitLab CI/CD                      |
| Backup         | Velero                            |
| Monitoring     | (Planned) Prometheus + Grafana    |

## ✅ Key Results

- 🚀 Infrastructure deployed 100% using Terraform modules
- 🐳 Apps fully containerized and deployed via GitLab CI
- 🔁 Backups working via Velero + S3
- ☁️ Ready-to-scale, cloud-native environment

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add real-time monitoring and alerting (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Harden Kubernetes security and apply IAM policies
- Adopt GitOps using tools like ArgoCD
